# Identification_of_fish_species

This project is based on identification of the fish species. In order to develop species- specific advisories, it is necessary to collect the fish-catch information to be categorized at some authentic level with an enhanced accuracy. Often species level catch reporting is having technical hindrances due to several reasons pertaining to manual efforts, one among them would be ignorance about particular species in specific which results to low reporting. Henceforth,Deep Learning based tool for image-based identification of fish-species found in the waterresource is to be developed. For creating an application fisher need to take a photo of fishes caught and fish identification will be done automatically after classifying it based on the size minimizing the manual intervention.This species classifying application is planned to be 
developed using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to achieve maximum accuracy.
